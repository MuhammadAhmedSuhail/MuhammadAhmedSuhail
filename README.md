## About Me

Hello, fellow data enthusiasts! üòÑ I'm **Muhammad Ahmed Suhail**, a passionate data scientist with a knack for turning complex data into valuable insights. In this ever-evolving world of data, I enjoy exploring trends, uncovering patterns, and solving challenging problems using cutting-edge techniques. My goal is to make data science accessible and impactful in various domains.

## Skills

- **Data Analysis:** From cleaning and transforming data to performing exploratory analysis, I thrive on extracting meaningful information from diverse datasets.
- **Machine Learning:** Applying various algorithms and models to train predictive models and make accurate predictions is one of my core strengths.
- **Data Visualization:** Presenting data in a visually appealing and informative manner using charts, graphs, and interactive dashboards is my forte.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Leveraging statistical methods to uncover patterns, validate hypotheses, and derive actionable insights.
- **Python Programming:** Proficient in Python, I utilize its rich ecosystem of libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn to streamline data workflows.
- **SQL:** Comfortable with SQL, I can efficiently query and manipulate databases to extract the required information.
- **Methodologies:** Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Mining, Natural Language Processing, Advanced Statistics, AI, Big Data Analytics, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing.
- **Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib), R (Dplyr, Ggplot2), SQL, C++, Java, JavaScript (React, Node, Express, Next), Typescript.
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Tableau, Git, Flask, MS Excel, VS Code, R Studio, Eclipse, MongoDB.

## Projects

Check out some of my noteworthy projects:

1. [Near Real-Time DataWarehouse Analysis](https://github.com/MuhammadAhmedSuhail/Near-Real-Time-DataWarehouse-Analysis): Developed a near-real-time Data Warehouse for a Shopping Store whose
transactions totaled 10000,enabling real-time analysis of customer behavior and optimizing selling strategies through
ETL tools and data enrichment.
2. [Face Recognition Using KNN](https://github.com/MuhammadAhmedSuhail/Face-Recognition-using-KNN): Implemented a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier, SVM, and GaussianNB for face
recognition, and then compared the results in a report. Performed PCA on the datasets and visualized the reduced
datasets in a 3-D space
3. [RUHA Voice Assistant](https://github.com/MuhammadAhmedSuhail/RUHA-Voice-Assistant): This project aims to train 5 classifiers on the RUHA audio dataset using scikit-learn. After evaluating their performance, a Flask web application will be created for users to interact with the trained classifiers, providing input and receiving creatively displayed predictions. Additionally, a result analytics page will showcase the performance of the classifiers on the dataset.
